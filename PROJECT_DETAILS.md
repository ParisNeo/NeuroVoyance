# Neurovoyance

Neurovoyance is a decentralized AI inference and training system that harnesses the power of a community to enable efficient and scalable AI processing. This project aims to empower AI developers and users by providing a peer-to-peer network and a reward system for contributing resources.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the Neurovoyance project are:

1. Build a decentralized AI inference and training system.
2. Utilize decentralized compute power to enhance AI capabilities.
3. Foster collaboration and community involvement in AI development.

## Approach

To achieve these objectives, the Neurovoyance project will be structured around the following components:

1. User Nodes:
   - Each user will have a node with resources such as CPU, memory, GPU, etc.
   - These nodes will contain value as they can perform work.
   - Users will connect to a peer-to-peer network.

2. Hive Mind:
   - The peer-to-peer network will act as a decentralized entity for resource allocation and task distribution.
   - The governance of the Hive Mind will be decentralized, with decision-making processes based on voting by stakeholders.
   - The objective is to develop a system that benefits the community and has protection mechanisms against huge speculation and cashout.

3. Clients:
   - The clients will be companies or individuals who seek the power of the peer-to-peer network for AI-based tasks, such as training their models.
   - They will pay in a cryptocurrency specifically built for this decentralized system.

4. Reward System:
   - The system will reward the resource nodes with the same cryptocurrency for their contribution.
   - The rewarding system will have protection mechanisms to prevent excessive speculation and cashout, ensuring the stability and sustainability of the ecosystem.

5. Bootstrap Nodes:
   - Bootstrap nodes will be used to initialize and maintain the peer-to-peer network.
   - They will help in the discovery and connection of user nodes.

## Importance of Open Sourcing

The Neurovoyance project recognizes the importance of open sourcing the tool. By making the system open source, it allows for transparency, collaboration, and the involvement of skilled open-source developers. The decentralized governance between stakeholders ensures that all decisions are taken by voting, promoting a fair and inclusive environment.

## Roadmap

The roadmap for the Neurovoyance project is as follows:

1. Attract skilled open-source developers to contribute to the project and enhance the functionality and features of the system.
2. Develop and refine the Hive Mind, ensuring seamless resource allocation and task distribution.
3. Implement the reward system, incorporating protection mechanisms against excessive speculation and cashout.
4. Test and optimize the system's performance and scalability.
5. Establish partnerships with AI companies and organizations to encourage adoption and utilization of the decentralized AI inference and training system.
6. Continuously improve and upgrade the system based on feedback and user requirements.
7. Expand the ecosystem by integrating with other projects and networks, fostering collaboration and interoperability.

By following this roadmap, the Neurovoyance project aims to create a robust and sustainable decentralized AI inference and training system that benefits the community and drives advancements in AI technology.
